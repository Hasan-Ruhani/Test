 I took this step to install Laravel document 

1. Open gitbash and run this command
   "composer create-project laravel/laravel LaravelApp"

2. When install complete "LaravelApp" then again run this command
   "composer install" 

3. Then go to correct path to "LaravelApp" and run this command
   "php artisan serve"

4. Now go to any brower and type http://localhost:8000 then press enter key.
