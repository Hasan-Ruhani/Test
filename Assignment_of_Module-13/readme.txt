To complete my assignment, I first run "composer install" and then use 
the Laravel installation command in gitbash to create a Laravel file 
named "LaravelApp". Then, using "php artisan serve" command in gitbash, 
I start my localhost server and run it in my browser. It successfully 
displays the correct results.

Next, I create a Route file named "hello" and it also runs successfully. 
Lastly, I have saved screenshots and a list of all my tasks in my GitHub 
repository link.
